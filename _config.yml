          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my time at MSU I've learned what it means to be a spartan. Its key in life to strike a balance between career and personal life with a work hard play hard lifestyle.

          I spent a lot of my free time exploring the East Lansing area and studying with friends.
